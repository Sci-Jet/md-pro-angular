        "Minimalistic but perfect custom scrollbar plugin."

        <br>
        <b>!IMPORTANT</b> Perfect Scrollbar is applied on the
        <code>.main-panel</code> and
        <code>.sidebar .sidebar-wrapper</code> so we will have a nice scrollbar that is visible only when you actually scroll. Since it is changing the overflows of the CSS it is also affecting the child elements which have a scroll so please make sure that you add the class
        <code>.ps-child</code> to any element that should have scroll.
