            If you have lengthy forms to complete, you can use the Bootstrap Wizard. This plugin allows you to cut the form into steps and let the user complete it gradually. We have worked over the original repository from <a href="https://twitter.com/gabrielva" target="_blank">Vincent Gabriel</a>, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/VinceG/twitter-bootstrap-wizard" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />
            We have changed the typography, inputs, buttons and we have added validation for inputs. You can see how it looks and feels in the live demo.
